Error: The model does not contain posterior draws.
In addition: Warning messages:
1: Found 22 observations with a pareto_k > 0.7 in model 'model'. We recommend to set 'moment_match = TRUE' in order to perform moment matching for problematic observations.  
2: 
218 (8.4%) p_waic estimates greater than 0.4. We recommend trying loo instead. 
3: Found 10 observations with a pareto_k > 0.7 in model 'model'. We recommend to set 'moment_match = TRUE' in order to perform moment matching for problematic observations.  
4: 
195 (7.6%) p_waic estimates greater than 0.4. We recommend trying loo instead. 
5: Found 6 observations with a pareto_k > 0.7 in model 'model'. We recommend to run more iterations to get at least about 2200 posterior draws to improve LOO-CV approximation accuracy.
