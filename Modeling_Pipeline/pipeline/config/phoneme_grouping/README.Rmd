# Phoneme Grouping Definitions

This folder contains files specifying different phoneme groupings that may be used for modeling.

## `phoneme_grouping1.csv`

This file follows **Kent’s phoneme complexity levels**.  
It includes the columns:

- **type** (Vowels, Consonants)
- **level**  
  - Vowels: Levels 1 through 5  
  - Consonants: Levels 3 through 6  
- **expected_phonemes**

Example:  
The group *(Vowels, Level 3)* contains the phonemes:

```
AO, AY, AW, OY
```

## `phoneme_grouping2.csv`

This file is used when each phoneme is modeled **independently**.  
To maintain consistent structure when reading and processing grouping files, each phoneme is assigned an **arbitrary level** (purely for organizational purposes; it has no modeling interpretation).
