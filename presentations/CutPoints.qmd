## Background: Phoneme Goodness Score curves <span class="subtitle-small">(1/2)</span>


- Our primary input is a set of likelihood values assigned by a Wav2Vec2-based acoustic model (PyPLLRComputer software), to each target phoneme in speech recordings obtained from typically developing children.

- We define Phoneme Goodness Score as the geometric mean of the likelihood assigned to the target phoneme.

- For each phoneme we model a **growth curve** of Phoneme Goodness Score  vs. age using a **Bayesian Beta regression**.

## What does the growth curve mean?

- For most phonemes, the **goodness score increases with age**.
- This increase might involve:

  - **Linguistic component**  
    - improved articulation / acquisition
    

  - **Physiological component**  
    - maturation / growth of the vocal tract, etc.

## How can growth curves inform phoneme articulation mastery? <span class="subtitle-small">(1/3)</span>

We aim to establish **age-dependent threshold curves** on the Phoneme Goodness Score trajectories such that:

- For each age, the value in the threshold curve represents the **cutpoint** or  minimum score consistent with **mastery of articulation**, and  

- Values **below** this cut-point indicate **insufficient mastery** or incomplete phonological acquisition.

If a **constant (age-invariant) threshold line** were sufficient,
we could hypothesize that **the phoneme goodness score mainly reflects articulation mastery**, with minimal influence from physiological maturation.

If the required threshold **increases substantially with age**,
then the goodness score is, to some extent, **reflecting physiological maturation rather than pure articulatory mastery**.

## Crowe & McLeod: normative acquisition curves. <span class="subtitle-small">(1/2)</span>

Crowe & McLeod (2020) analyzed data from 15 studies (Approx. 18,900 children) and reported, for each English consonant:

- The **mean age** at which children reach  
  **50%, 75%, and 90% accuracy** in producing that phoneme, and the corresponding **standard deviations** across studies.

- $x\%$ criterion indicates that $x\%$ of the participants produced the consonant correctly.

We are using these normative values as **reference anchors** for the  cut-point definition.

## AAPS: probability of success vs. age <span class="subtitle-small">(1/2)</span>

- **Arizona Articulation and Phonology Scale (AAPS)**: standardized
assessment that evaluates whether a child correctly produces a target phoneme in a structured elicitation task. 

- We use AAPS scoring data from the same participants for whom Phoneme Goodness values were computed.

- From these binary (0/1) outcomes we fit a **Bayesian Binomial model** to estimate, for each phoneme, the **probability of correct production** as a function of age.

## Integrating normative and model-based information
<div class="small-slide">

Our goal is to define, for each phoneme and age,  a **Phoneme Goodness threshold** indicating mastery of articulation.

We integrate three components:

1. **Crowe & McLeod (2020):** Normative ages for **50%, 75%, and 90% accuracy**.

2. **AAPS Bayesian Binomial model:**  For each age,  
   $\color{blue}{q(\text{age})} = P(\text{100% correct} \mid \text{age})$  gives the *probability of mastery*.

3. **Goodness score (Y) - Bayesian Beta model:**  We find $\color{red}{x_q(\text{age})}$ such that  $P\big(Y \ge \color{red}{x_q(\text{age})} \mid \text{age}\big)
     = \color{blue}{q(\text{age})}$.

$\color{red}{x_q(\text{age})}$ is the proposed  **age-dependent Phoneme Goodness Score Threshold**.

- **Red line:** Mean acquisition age = **35 months** (Crowe & McLeod).  
  Projecting the red segment onto the **x-axis** gives the **±2 SD age range** around this mean.  
  Threshold at this age: **0.06** (Score ≥ 0.06 → likely mastered).

- **Green line:** Threshold at **48 months** = **0.02**.

- **Purple line:** Threshold at **67 months** = **0.02**.

- **Black curve:** Connects these three values → **age-dependent Goodness Score threshold**.
