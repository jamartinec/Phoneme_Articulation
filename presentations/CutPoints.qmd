## 1. Background: PLLR growth curves

- Our data consist of **PLLR scores** produced by the PyPLLRComputer (Wav2Vec2 model) applied to child speech recordings. 
- PLLR reflects how close each phoneme production is to its expected acoustic target.
- For each phoneme we model a **growth curve** of Phoneme Goodness Score (function of PLLR) vs. age using a **Bayesian Beta regression**.

## 2. What does the growth curve mean?

- For most phonemes, the **PLLR goodness score increases with age**.
- This increase has two components:

  - **Linguistic component**  
    - improved articulation / acquisition
    

  - **Physiological component**  
    - maturation / growth of the vocal tract, etc.

---

## 3. Main Question

- For each **phoneme** and **age**, we want to find a **cut point** in the goodness score that marks the transition between:

- **Improving articulation / acquisition**  , and  **Mainly physiological maturation**

(score improves because the child grows, not because the phoneme is correctly produced).

## 4. Crowe & McLeod (2020): normative acquisition curves

Crowe & McLeod analyzed data from 15 studies (Approx. 18,900 children) and reported,
for each English consonant:

- The **mean age** at which children reach  
  **50%, 75%, and 90% accuracy** in producing that phoneme, and the corresponding **standard deviations** across studies.

- 90% criterion indicates that 90% of the participants produced the consonant correctly.

We are using these normative values as **reference anchors** for the  cut-point definition.

## 5. AAPS: probability of success vs. age

- **Arizona Articulation and Phonology Scale (AAPS)**: standardized
assessment that evaluates whether a child correctly produces a target phoneme in a structured elicitation task. 

- We use AAPS scoring data from the same participants for whom PLLR values were computed.

- From these binary (0/1) outcomes we fit a **Bayesian Binomial model** to estimate, for each phoneme, the **probability of correct production** as a function of age.

## 6. Integrating normative and model-based information
<div class="small-slide">

Our goal is to define, for each phoneme and age,  a **Phoneme Goodness cutpoint** marking the transition between  
**linguistic acquisition** and **physiological maturation**.

We integrate three components:

1. **Crowe & McLeod (2020):** Normative ages for **50%, 75%, and 90% accuracy**.

2. **AAPS Bayesian Binomial model:**  For each age,  
   $\color{blue}{q(\text{age})} = P(\text{100% correct} \mid \text{age})$  gives the *probability of mastery*.

3. **Goodness score (Y) - Bayesian Beta model:**  We find $\color{red}{x_q(\text{age})}$ such that  $P\big(Y \ge \color{red}{x_q(\text{age})} \mid \text{age}\big)
     = \color{blue}{q(\text{age})}$.

This yields an **age-dependent PLLR cutpoint** per phoneme.

## 7. Phoneme Goodness  Cutpoints 

This figure combines:

1. The **Bayesian Goodness score growth curve** (posterior median and 50% and 95% credible band),
2. The **raw Goodness scores** (grey points),
3. And the **Crowe & McLeod age criteria** (50%, 75%, 90% acquisition).
4. For each C&M age point, we compute the corresponding  
**age-dependent Goodness score threshold** $\color{red}{x_q(\text{age})}$ that matches the  
probability of mastery predicted by the binomial model over AAPS data.
